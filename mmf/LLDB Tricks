## Getting a stack trace in lldb when Xcode is broken [Aug 2025]

Init $fp like this:
    `e void *$fp = (void *)$x29`

Now alternate these two commands to print out the stack trace, starting at the caller of the current function:
    `image lookup -a *(((void**)$fp)+1)`
    `e $fp = *((void **)$fp)`
