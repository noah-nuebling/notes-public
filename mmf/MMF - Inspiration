    - This twitter thread is about how Logitech Options sucks and how they use LinearMouse instead. 
    - Nobody mentions MMF :'(
    - I think I saw some hackernews thread in the MMF 2 days and they also said they prefer LinerMouse
        - -> I think MMF doesn't appeal to the tech crowd (or at least the vocal ones on social media)
            - -> Once we have app-specific settings and Logitech support, it may appeal to them, too?
