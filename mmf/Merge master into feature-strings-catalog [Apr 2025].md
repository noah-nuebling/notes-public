# Merging master into feature-strings-catalog branch [Apr 2025]

Post-merge-todos: 
        (Copied (and then extended) from commit message 0a3d69731535082522ac69732edaa80ba65ffada)
    - [x] Looks like there's still some stuff in the project.pbxproj that has 10.14.4 as deployment target.
        -> Check and probably update to 10.15.0
    - [x] Uncomment .h imports until it compiles (we commented some out since we weren't sure they were needed.)
    - [x] Looks like **setupBasicCocoaLumberjackLogging** is not called anywhere after merge?
        -> Investigate
            Result: We replaced it with +setUpDDLog 
                - [x] Merge changes into setUpDDLog and delete setupBasicCocoaLumberjackLogging
                - [x] Delete occurences of `import CocoaLumberjackSwift`. The import is done by Logging.swift now.
    - [x] Address all "MERGE TODO:" comments in the source code.
    - [x] Double-check if any UI strings changed in master since master and feature-strings-catalog diverged
        -> Cause I think we just deleted all the UIStrings from master during the merge
    - [x] Search for comments mentioning feature-strings-catalog,
        -> Reasoning: to catch cases where we 'backported' stuff from feature-strings-catalog to master
        I saw one such cases where git just duplicated the backported code â€“ maybe there are other such cases
    - [x] Looks like getMFRedirectionServiceLink() is not called anywhere after merge
        -> Investigate
        -> Result: Functionality was moved into Links.m
    - [x] Replace custom local bcase() macros we wrote in last commit with the proper ones defined in SharedUtility.h
    - [x] Delete/clean up MFDataClassImpls and MFDataClassImplementations
        - Those files are empty and I think they're duplications of each other.
    - [x] Make any other changes to get the program to compile and run bug-free
        - Maybe we should make a list with the functionalities where the merge was the most complicated, and we could test if we introduced any bugs there?
            - Complicated merge: Licensing system
            - Complicated merge: ... (I forgot, there were more)
            - -> Update: Too lazy to do this. I think wel'll find any bugs naturally during further development.
    - [ ] Merge EventLoggerForBrad side project
        - IIRC we postponed merging this into MMF just because that required us to change some code that feature-strings-catalog also changed â€“ so we wanted to wait until master and feature-strings-catalog were merged. 
    - /Move over/cleanup/get overview of/ utilities from recent 'side projects' (Before we forget about them)
        Overview â€“Â merging of recent side projects:
            - [ ] objc-playground-2024
                - Contains block-based KVO wrapper
            - [x] xcode-localization-screenshot-fix
                - DONE: Nothing to merge but some interesting stuff left in that repo. Made note about that inside mac-mouse-fix > `Automatic Localization Screenshots.md`
            - EventLoggerForBrad
                - We already moved over some stuff and it's split between SharedUtility.h and EventLoggerForBradMacros.h â€“ maybe other files?
        -> I think it would be nice to merge everything useful into MMF now, and then we can forget about those other repos

            (This date doesn't make sense with 77958a595 being [Jun 24 2024], I think? We had a bunch of different branches for localization stuff so maybe we merged them in a weird way.?)

## LicenseSheetController.swift merge conflic resolution

    What happened on **master** branch?

        - [Feb 1 2025] Improvements to the licensing code
            - Task.detached now has @MainActor annotation
            - Comment added above Task.detached dispatch
            - Comment added next to `guard let tabViewController = MainAppState.shared` about observed crash

        - [Oct 6 2024] - [Nov 5 2024] May commits
            - Made isProcessing @Atomic
            - Under 'server validation', we cleaned up/improved the whole logic and now use the new rewritten Licensing module with async/await and stuff
                - Here's what the code changed to: <see below>
            - displayUserFeedback was updated a lot, what I can see
                - Small comments added & Swift force-unwrapping removed
                - args changed: 
                    - Removed: LicenseREason,
                    - Added: licenseTypeInfo, licenseTypeInfoOverride,
                    - Renamed: success -> isValidLicense, userChangedKey->isActivation
                - The following sections have changed a lot:
                    - Everythin above /// Show server error  (formerly /// Show message)
                        - Most significant restructuring I can see is that license-toast.free-country code is in the isValidLicense==false branch now, controlled by licenseTypeInfoOverride instead of licenseReason
                        - Also MFLicenseTypeRequiresValidLicenseKey() validation
                        - Added `assert(licenseTypeInfo != nil)` validation
                    - Added `case kMFLicenseErrorCodeServerResponseInvalid:` 
              
        - [Feb 28 2024] Setup toast notifications if MMF takes too long
            - (Last common commit with feature-strings-catalog)


    What happened on **feature-strings-catalog** branch?

        - [Aug 29 2029] Removed 'First draft:'s from localizer hints
            - What commit msg says

        - [Aug 11 2024] Rewrote attributeStringByTrimmingWhitespace:
            - x Changed stringByTrimmingWhiteSpace() to stringByRemovingAllWhiteSpace() 

        - [Jul 30 2024] Refactor & cleanup of toast notification code
            - MOved stuff into LicenseToasts instead of using local displayUserFeedback() helper and ToastNotificationController. 

        - [Feb 28 2024] Setup toast notifications if MMF takes too long
            - Changed toast duration automatic <-> -1 (which is the same thing)
            - (Last common commit)

                    ///     - By checking for valueFreshness we filter out the case where there's no internet but the cache still tells us it's licensed
                    ///         The way things are currently set up this leads to weird behaviour when activating a license without internet in freeCountries: If the cache says it's licensed, users will get the no internet error, but if the cache says it's not licensed. Users will get the it's free in your country message. This is because the freeCountry overrides inside activateLicense only take effect if isLicensed is false. This is slightly weird but it's such a small edge case that I don't think it matters. Although it hints that it might be more logical to change the logic for applying the freeCountry overrides.
