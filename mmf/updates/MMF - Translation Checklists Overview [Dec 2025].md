Other ideas:
    Add to Questions section of translation_guide.md:
        - [x] 'Edit xliff file directly?' 
        - [xxx] 'Initial translations for a language should be larger chunks?'
            - Not adding this. I don't have a 'clear policy' on this, yet. It's kinda understandable that minimal effort won't be accepted. Text already speaks of 'if your incomplete translations are accepted, you will get credits'. 
    - [x] Say thanks to the Brazilian translator on GitHub who complimented (but we rejected their submission, sorry :'()
