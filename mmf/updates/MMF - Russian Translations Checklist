**Translation Files**

(Should maybe do this more frequently than publishing updates [Nov 2025])

Import: 
    - [ ] Import .xcloc files in Xcode
        - [ ] In mac-mouse-fix
        - [ ] In mac-mouse-fix-website

    - Update website
        - [ ] `pnpm upload`

    - Update app
        - [ ] 

    - Update Markdown files:
        - [ ] `./run build-markdown` on ALL the docs (Acknowledgements.md / Readme.md / Support.md / CapturedButtonsMMF3.md / ...)
        - [ ] Run testTakeScreenshots_Documentation()

    - Update Translation Guide
    - [ ] `./run uploadstrings` on the master branch (Will run testTakeScreenshots_Localization())
        - (Tip: Maybe on a second computer cause this takes a while)
        - (Note: If this gets annoying, look into automating with GitHub Actions runner.)
        - (Note: Currently have to manually build 'App' scheme first [Nov 2025]) 
            - (Background: The Localization Screenshot Taker doesn't auto-build to speed up iteration times - but that creates a footgun here – I think at least)

    Other:
      - [ ] If new UI added – Consider updating `testTakeScreenshots_Localization()` to cover it before running `./run uploadstrings`
