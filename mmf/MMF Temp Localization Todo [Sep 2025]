[Sep 9 2025] 
    Context: I wrote a bunch of TODOs and notes in **recent commits** on the feature-strings-catalog branch
    Purpose: I'm now consolidating them into this note. 
    Backlink: This note is referenced by this commit: abbfe0f4a2ced970ca07426b1954a1b4a54bf2cc

The TODOs and context are for the purpose of:

>> Continuing to write the **CapturedButtonsMMF3.md document**
	    and improving / finishing the new MMF localization system. <<

(Note: The commits below aren't quite accurate anymore because I reorganized and edited the TODOs [Sep 9 2025])

# TODOs / context from recent commits:

1. fda78fcccc106744b95e5b2967713b651f9d80e7

	Higher-level-todo in **notes-public > `MMF - Discontinuing GitHub Discussions.md`**

2. 45e5db3cc0caf547e0a7d65aa6c4eff817b6ee80

	Added outline of our plan for writing the CapturedButtonsMMF3.md document at
	the **top of the CapturedButtonsMMF3.md template**

3. 77dcfae0c19c1f2bccd1a0bb1b9dc7601f0eed2c

     Updated TODO:

    1. [x] Make other documents than Support.md use insert_docnames()
    2. [x] Go through all the other docs and fix up the title and footer for the
        new context they live in
    3. [x] Move the 'CompareVersion2And3.md' text into the 3.0.0 update notes.
    4. [x] Write the 'Captured Mouse Buttons' Guide for MMF 3
           Also ended up writing CapturedScrollWheels.md!
    5. [x] Backport all the text for `CapturedButtonsMMF3.md` and `CapturedScrollWheels.md` from German to English,
            and polish the text and stuff.
    6. [x] Do final grammer check and editing on everything.
            - [x] Check that all the links work in all the languages.
    7. [ ] Take care of the the `{url}` localizer hint in plstrings.

    - [x] Generate the screenshots programmatically, so that we
        can localize them (and so we can easily update them when
        the design of MMF / macOS changes.)


4. 47cf388b8fef3f5d9be59c7db17d75164de85f7d

    - [ ] TODO: Pull the 3.0.6 changes from master after we're done writing the documents.

 5. New TODOs (Don't appear in previous commits)

 	Stuff I noticed while taking the CapturedButtonsMMF3.md screenshots:
 		- [ ] Fix CaptureToasts.m capitalization and pluralization in German
 		- [ ] Revert the 'greyed out subtitle' style for the CaptureToasts
 		    – Consistency with the other Toasts is more important
 		- [ ] Localization issues:
 			- [ ] In some of the translations we added, the screens are super
 			    wide due to where the linebreaks are set in the translated text
 			- [ ] Some of the French text is super long (I don't think it should be
 			    much longer than German?)
 	Other
    - [x] Programmatically insert images into CapturedButtonsMMF3.md instead of having localizers type HTML
 		- [ ] Edit the Readme Q&A to link the CapturedButtonsMMF3.md instead of
 		    duplicating the information.
 			  (Blender Orbiting section – maybe others?)


7. Added [Sep 9 2025] (and after)

    - [ ] Add links to CapturedScrollWheels.md
        - [ ] Inside MMF
        - [ ] In Support.md
        - [ ] In CapturedButtonsMMF3.md
    - [x] Add localizer hints for the 2 localizable guides
        - [ ] Maybe link to the images for context?
     - We defined the localizer hints in the .xcstrings files instead of the .md templates!
        - [ ] Either move localizer hints to .md templates, or to .xcstrings files across all .xcstrings files in the repo
        - [ ] Make it an assert failure to define the localizer hints in the 'wrong' place. (Or at least make sure they aren't getting silently overriden by the 'other place.')

(Not sure if putting TODOs and context into git commits like this is any good,
    but it's interesting to experiment :))
    ... Update: [Sep 2025] It's not that good because you can't edit the TODOs later to check them off.
    I think it's sometimes good for capturing project context and thoughts on a whim – but not so much for stuff you plan to edit.
