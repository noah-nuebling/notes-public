### Background

So today (Oct 22 2024) I got sucked into researching how to improve bug reports for Mac Mouse Fix. I don't want to work on this right now, since I don't want to get sidetracked from working on the Licensing System. So I'm putting my ideas here so I don't forget them.

## Motivation: We never get Console Logs

So for mac-mouse-fix bug reports there are generally 3 tiers of actionable diagnostic data we request from users:

1. Reproduction Steps
2. Crash Reports
3. Console Logs

(These 3 type of data are also requested by mac-mouse-fix-feedback-assistant)

For **hard-to-reproduce crashes**, we really want the **Console Logs**, it's the most detailed way to introspect an application, short of attaching a debugger. 

However - **We almost never get Console logs from users.**

In the last days I've had several reports about hard-to-reproduce issues and every time, once I tell them how to gather Console Logs, I just don't get any replies anymore. (This is really funny for some reason.) \
Currently, we just tell users to always run Console.app in the background and then note down the time and copy-paste the logs once the error occurs. (We don't even tell them that you can select all of the (potentially millions) of logs with Command-A, so if they don't know that, they're in a bad spot. Lmao. I didn't think this through.)

I think this is clearly prohibitively hard to do. 

**-> If we want to effectively address hard-to-reproduce bugs, we need to make it easier for people to gather and send Console Logs.**

## How do we make it easier 
... for people to gather / send Diagnostic Data (primarily Console Logs)

### Steps

So, in order for us to receive actionable Console Logs, the following **steps** need to happen:

1. The user needs to enable production *and* storage of full, verbose logs
2. The user needs to reproduce the issue
3. The user needs to make a timestamp for when the issue occured (Otherwise we're unlikely to find the relevant logs among millions)
4. The user needs to retrieve the stored logs
5. The user needs to send the retrieved logs to us alongside the timestamp (through a private channel if the logs might contain sensitive data, and we also need to inform users about the privacy implications before they send the data)
6. The user needs to disable production and storage of full, verbose logs after they have sent the logs (as not to waste resources)

^ These things are invariants - they need to happen no matter how we design our system. 

The question is - how can we design our system such that these steps as simple as possible (without taking an unreasonable amount of time and effort for us to implement.)

### Step 1: Enabling full, verbose logs (Elevating logLevel)

Currently, in Mac Mouse Fix, we set a logLevel inside CocoaLumberJack based on the type of build of Mac Mouse Fix (IIRC, the CCLJ logLevel is `default` for release builds and `debug` for `prerelease builds` which are builds that either have the `DEBUG` compiler flag set or that Have 'Beta' or 'Alpha' in their version string.)

#### Simplification: Unifying OS logLevel with CocoaLumberJack logLevel
   However, these logs from CocoaLumberJack end up in the unified system log, which has a separate log-level-based-filtering system from CCLJ.
   Both systems have the same concept of hierarchical logLevels, and their names are also the same IIRC.
   Here's a description of the 4 logLevels in the unified system log from `man log`:
      `level: {off | default | info | debug} The level is a hierarchy, e.g. debug implies debug, info, and default.`

   If we end up using the unified system log for storing logs (which seems like the best way, although I haven't investigated alternatives much), then the CCLJ logLevels are redundant and they complicate things! 
   For example, if we set the CocoaLumberJzack logLevel to `debug`, but the OS logLevel is `default` then the app would produce `debug` and `info` messages but they would all immediately be thrown away by the unified system log, without being stored anywhere. (Update: Actually, `info` messages would get stored to memory first, and get written to disk when an `error` or `fault` message occurs - According to the WWDC 2016 Talk [6]) If the situation was reversed, then the unified system log would be expecting `debug` and `info` messages but the app would never produce them.

   -> Therefore, (to simplify the process of enabling full, verbose logs for users) we should probably **synchronize the logLevel** between the app and the OS ('OS' meaning the unified system log)
   (That is, unless we end up using - instead of the unified system log - some custom 'logging backend' for CocoaLumberJack (This custom backend would (perhaps among other things I can't remember rn) manage writing the logs to a file instead of the unified system log managing that.)

  To 'synchronize' the log levels, and clean things up, we could do the following:\
  1. We could remove CocoaLumberJack from our codebase, and use the unified system log directly. To do this we could simply redefine the CCLJ logging macros to invoke os_log() instead. E.g. DDLogDebug(...) would invoke os_log_debug(OS_LOG_DEFAULT, ...). These new macros might cause some additional overhead, since they wouldn't be stripped out by the compiler in release builds - which I think is what CocoaLumberJack does - but I believe the overhead would be very small.
  2. We could remove the dependency on the unified system log and use a custom logging backend for CocoaLumberJack instead. Then we could fully control the logging behavior by modifying the state of CocoaLumberJack while the app is running.
  3. We could configure our Info.plist to always enable the highest logLevel (`debug`) on the OS level, so that the OS would never filter our logs. (More on that below) Then we could control the logLevel using just the app-internal CocoaLumberJack logLevel.

#### Simplification: No need for DEBUG builds

Currently, when compiling the app with the DEBUG compiler flag, this has primarily (purely?) 3 effects: 
1. Making it possible to attach a debugger
2. Doing some extra validation such as 'assert()'
3. Enabling verbose logging

When we currently distribute 'debug builds' to users with hard-to-reproduce issues, we build the app with the DEBUG flag in order to activate verbose logging. However, in these cases, we don't need the other features of the DEBUG flag - attaching a debugger and assert().

It seems better to control logging verbosity separately from the DEBUG compiler flag - this would then make it possible to enable verbose logging for any build of Mac Mouse Fix by just running a terminal command. (or clicking a button in the app, or installing a profile, more on that later.)

To make this a reality, we'd have to say goodbye to using compiler flags to control logging behavior at all, and instead we'd have to use a fully dynamic 'logLevel'. We could do this by either managing logLevels internally by using CocoaLumberJack logLevels / using `static` variables inside the app, or we could simply rely on the OS logLevels that the unified system log assigns to our process.

To remove reliance on the DEBUG complier flag and let the app's logging be fully controlled by the OS we could make 2 simple changes to the codebase: 

- 1. The refactor propsed above, where we remove CocoaLumberJack alongside its logLevels in favour of `os_log()` - relying on the logLevels that the unified system log provides.
- 2. We already have a way to control logging-verbosity independent of the DEBUG flag it's called `runningPrerelease()`. Currently it checks the DEBUG flag as well as whether the app's version string contains 'Alpha' or 'Beta'. We could simply replace `runningPrerelease()` with a new function called something like `verboseLogsEnabled()` and define that in terms of `os_log_info_enabled(OS_LOG_DEFAULT)` and/or `os_log_debug_enabled(OS_LOG_DEFAULT)`. (These macros let us monitor the current logLevel that the unified system log assigned to our process.)

-> With these 2 changes, the app's logging behavior would be fully controlled by the unified system log! Meaning that we could enable/disable full, verbose logs at runtime with a single `log config` terminal command (* with one caveat - stripping of private data - more on that later)

#### Implementation Details: How to change OS logLevel?

Quoting Quinn "The Eskimo" [1]:
```
You can customise [the OS logLevel] in [...] different ways:

- Add an OSLogPreferences property to your appâ€™s Info.plist (all platforms).
- Run the log tool with the config command (macOS only)
- Create and install a custom configuration profile with the com.apple.system.logging payload (macOS only).
```

Which of these 3 approaches should we choose? 

1. Configuration Profile

Apple seems to use profiles (They sent me a profile for this purpose when I experienced a bug with iCloud)
However, configuration profiles take quite a few steps to install and they seem a bit scary. I think this might deter some users.

The upside of using configuration profiles is that we could custom-craft them for the specific issue a user is experiencing - enabling verbose logs for all the processes that might be involved in the user's bug. 

... The only relevant process I could think of is `launchd` which has failed to start "Mac Mouse Fix Helper" in a myriad of ways over the years. So I feel like this flexibility to elevate logLevels for arbitrary processes isn't needed, (instead we could just hardcode elevated logLevels for relevant processes like `launchd`) But I'm not sure. 

2. Info.plist

If we we use this feature as intended, this would require users to download a separate 'debug build'. It would be nicer if they could just keep using their app normally. Also, I'm not totally sure how to automate changing the Info.plist content based on build type. (Probably using plistbuddy inside a build script should work though - that's how we increment the build number currently)

Alternatively we could just hardcode Mac Mouse Fix's logLevel to `debug` using the Info.plist and then use internal logLevels to control logging behavior.

-> HOWEVER, if we avoid modifying OS logLevels at all, (instead managing logLevels purely internally) we couldn't control the logLevel of other processes like `launchd` at all, which might be really helpful for some bugs! \
ðŸ’¡ This is a pretty strong argument to *not* manage logLevels internally and instead try to make the app adhere to OS logLevels, and then give users an as-easy-as-possible way to control OS logLevels.

3. `log` command-line-tool

Having the user run terminal commands to change their system configuration is probably a bit scary and not ideal.

However, we could use this CLT directly from inside Mac Mouse Fix using NSTask. This would be the easiest UX - we could simply have a menu item in the app that says something like 'Start Collecting Logs for a Bug Report...'. 

(On Private Data)

However, I have not seen a way to disable stripping private data from logs using `log` (When using a Configuration Profile or Info.plist you can use the `Enable-Private-Data` key for this purpose.) 

But based on Quinn's post [2] it looks like a configuration profile or Info.plist are the only ways to enable private data, and therefore there's no way tod do this using `log`

However, Mac Mouse Fix basically has access to zero sensitive data (at least that I can think of?) except for the user's license key. So perhaps we could just tag all the logged data as `{public}` inside the app and we won't ever have to worry about data privacy, and we could just use `log` without a problem.

## Steps 2. to 6.

I'm getting too tired to write stuff in detail, but here are a few more thoughts I had on the rest of the steps:

2. The user needs to reproduce the issue
   -> This can't be simplified
3. The user needs to make a timestamp for when the issue occured (Otherwise we're unlikely to find the relevant logs among millions)
4. The user needs to retrieve the stored logs
5. The user needs to send the retrieved logs to us alongside the timestamp
6. The user needs to disable production and storage of full, verbose logs after they have sent the logs (as not to waste resources)\


### Idea -> 3 - 6. could all be turned into one or two steps for the user

Perhaps we could have a special statusbaritem while recording debug logs, and the user could click on that and then choose an option called: 'The Bug Just Happened!...' This would make a timestamp, then gather diagnostic data, and then automatically compose an email addressed to me with the diagnostic data as an attachment, and then turn the logging off. (We'd also have to inform the user about the privacy implications of sending the data, see Quinn's post [0] and the `sudo sysdiagnose` privacy message [11] for more). 
    Update: [Apr 2025] sysdiagnose files are too large to send as email attachments, but we could upload them to some other file storage (Maybe `Netlify` blob, see below.)

How could we implement step 4. (retrieving stored logs)? We could programmatically gather logs for the user using the `sudo sysdiagnose` command, this gathers extremely extensive diagnostic data and seems to be what Apple requests from users (and what Quinn recommends for debug hard-to-reproduce problems [0]). Alternatively, we can find some diagnostic data like crash reports directly in the library, and if we use another backend for CocoaLumberJack we could probably store logs in a custom file and then just read that. Sysdiagnose is super extensive, but its complications are that it takes a few minutes to gather the info, and it requires administrator priviledges. This wouldn't be the case for a different CocoaLumberJack backend I think, so that might be easier to implement. I can't really think of any other ways to do Step 5. (retrieving stored logs) (Update: Actually we could use `log show` or `log collect` or `OSLogStore` programmatically as alternatives. More on that below.) I believe implementing the statusbaritem I mentioned might be quite hard. Alternatively, we could give the user step by step instructions. See <# Sysdiagnose instructions that Apple sent me> below.

### Sysdiagnose instructions that Apple sent me

Apple sent me these instructions when I had iCloud issues. 
(Their instruction about taking a screenshot to gather a timestamp for the bug is pretty smart.)

```
   1. Download the logging profile onto your Mac from the URL address below.
      https://beta.apple.com/download/1017668
   2. Double click on the downloaded profile to install it. You will need to authenticate as your admin user.
   3. When the profile is installed (and you can see it installed in System Settings >Privacy & Security > Profiles), reboot your machine to make it take effectj.
   4. When you're logged back in, create a new note in Obsidian.
   5. Wait a few minutes for logs to accrue and then trigger a screenshot with Shift-Cmd-3. (The timestamp of the screenshot will help us know where in the log files to look for events.)
   6. Immediately after that, capture a new system diagnostics report by hitting Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-Opt-period to start.  The screen will flash white to show that it's started.
   7. When the sysdiagnose is complete (it may take a few minutes), Finder will open a window to the directory where the log file has been created in /var/tmp/. Attach that back to us, along with the screenshot.
   8. Turn off the extra logging by removing the debug logging profile in the Profiles pref pane, using the "-" button. Then reboot your machine again
```

### Update: [Apr 2025] About step 3. (Taking timestamp-screenshot)

In  <# Sysdiagnose instructions that Apple sent me> they told me to trigger sysdiagnose, and then *immediately* take a screenshot. Is this really necessary? Won't the sysdiagnose contain enough info about when it was triggered?
Test:  
    Triggered sysdiagnose exactly at 11:08:00 using Shift-Ctrl-Cmd-Opt-period
Results: 
    - Resulting sysdiagnose's file's name contains `11-08-00`, and entries in sysdiagnose.log start at `11:08:00`
    - system_logs.logarchive logs go up to 11:10 which is also when the sysdiagnose archive was created. (sysdiagnose.log says that creating the logarchive is the last thing sysdiagnose does)

-> Taking screenshot immediately after triggering sysdiagnose seems entirely unnecessary
    Not sure why Apple told me to do that

## Other

Stuff I picked up from watching the WWDC 2016 Session: [6] which was unclear to me before:
- The os_log docs speak about logs that are stored to disk and logs that are stored to memory. As far as I understand the purpose of the 'stored in memory' messages is that they do also get written to disk IF an `OS_LOG_TYPE_ERROR` or `OS_LOG_TYPE_FAULT` message is sent afterwards. OS_LOG_TYPE_ERROR denotes process-level errors, while OS_LOG_TYPE_FAULT denotes errors on the scope of multiple processes. OS_LOG_TYPE_FAULT might cause even more extensive debug information to be saved than OS_LOG_TYPE_ERROR Quote: "Use `os_log_error` to cause additional information capture from app" "Use `os_log_fault` to cause additional information capture from system". Perhaps we should think of FAULT and ERROR as explicit ways to trigger such information capture and use default log level for 'normal' errors.
- Not only strings are private by default: "Dynamic strings, collections, and objects are assumed to be private."

Update (next day, Oct 23 2024): 

Another thing I haven't looked much into is exporting logs from inside the app. 
If we use the unified system log we could
- Use `sudo sysdiagnose -u` programmatically - but it would require the user to enter the admin password and would take a few minutes.
- Use OSLogStore API [13], but it only seems to be able to retrieve logs from the current process unless you're on macOS 12.0 or later where there's an option to retrieve the entire system log.
- Use the `log collect` or `log show` command line tool [7]  programmatically. It should be able to the same things as `OSLogStore` but it's perhaps more powerful. It doesn't even require `sudo` IIRC.
- -> If we can retrieve the system log using the `log` clt or `OSLogStore`, then we could just also programmatically gather crash reports from the library and that should be all the debug info we need. The other stuff inside a full sysdiagnose archive doesn't seem too useful (but I haven't thought about this much, so maybe it's better to heir on the side of collecting more information - which sysdiagnose would do? ... sysdiagnose also collects the attached USB Devices, which might be useful? so we can see what mouse the user is using ... but the user could also just tell us or we could gather that info separately inside MMF through IOKit...). However, I heard a few times that Apple encourages collecting sysdiagnose reports because, if it turns out to be a bug on Apple's side you can just send them the sysdiagnose and they'll have all the info to debug things.

Alsooo, we might want to think about the problem in terms of **things we could optimize for**

Basically, there are 3 things we wanna optimize the bug-reporting-process for:

1. Optimize to receive maximally detailed information (If we fully optimize for this, that would see us being able to enable verbose logs for arbitrary external processes like `launchctl` and then use `sysdiagnose` to extract all diagnostic info the system can provide.)
2. Optimize for the easiest possible user experience (If we fully optimize for that, we would probably have a simple toggle in the app to enable verbose logging, which would create a menu-bar-item with a "The bug just occured! Send the Info..." button, which would handle everything automatically - so the user might just have to click 3 or 4 UI items (measured without the reproduction of the issue) to complete the entire process. 
3. Optimize for development time and stability (If we fully optimize for this we would just do nothing, since that's the least bug-prone and time-consuming option.)

Now we could try to find the optimal balance between these 3 optimization points. But we could also do a sort of 'hybrid approach' or 'gradual approach'. 
For example, perhaps we could have a UX-optimized process be the default. And for cases where that doesn't provide enough information, we can implement a second information-optimized approach. Or we could roll out the information-optimized approach first (since that should also be relatively easy to implement) and then roll out a UX-optimized approach if we find that we still don't get enough actionable feedback.

Or we could try to find a good compromise between the 3 optimization-points and then adjust it based on how it's working.

... I'd have to think about this some more.

# Update [Feb 2025] - Short Term Solution

While we haven't implemented a better debugging system, yet, we're using some of the learnings from above to debug hard-to-reproduce bugs in the short-term.

We do that by creating and distributing special 'debug builds' that produce and store verbose logs.

## 1. Create a 'verbose-debug-logging' build of the app

### 1.1) Set the DDLogLevel 

-> to DDLogLevelAll / .all (for both Swift and objc)

### 1.2) Maybe add (Debug) to the Version String

- ... So you can more easily differentate the debug version.
- Also helps users not accidentally keep using the debug build long-term.
- E.g. `3.0.4 Beta 1 (Debug)`
    - For the third debug version, we used `3.0.4 Beta 1 (Debug v3)`

### 1.3) Remove the NDEBUG flags

From the Swift `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS` and the C `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`.

-> That way assert() calls get enabled.
	(Actually, isn't it better to not have assert() crash the app so it behaves exactly like a non-'verbose-debug-logging' build?)

### 1.4) Add DEBUG flags

In the same places you removed the NDEBUG flags

-> That way, runningPreRelease() definitely returns true, and some code sections wrapped in `#if DEBUG` get enabled.
	([Apr 2025] Not really necessary for versions containing 'Beta' or 'Alpha' since runningPreRelease() already returns true for them.)

### 1.5) Add this dict to Info.plist under the `OSLogPreferences` key.
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>com.nuebling.mac-mouse-fix</key>
	<dict>
		<key>DEFAULT-OPTIONS</key>
		<dict>
			<key>Signpost-Enabled</key>
			<false/>
			<key>Enable-Private-Data</key>
			<false/>
			<key>Signpost-Scope</key>
			<string>Process</string>
			<key>Enable-Oversize-Messages</key>
			<true/>
			<key>Signpost-Persisted</key>
			<false/>
			<key>Level</key>
			<dict>
				<key>Persist</key>
				<string>Debug</string>
				<key>Enable</key>
				<string>Debug</string>
			</dict>
			<key>Signpost-Backtraces-Enabled</key>
			<false/>
		</dict>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>

```
Notes:
- This assumes that all logs from mainApp and helperApp are using the `com.nuebling.mac-mouse-fix` subsystem.
  - -> Make sure to use that subsystem when setting up the DDOSLogger.
- You can simply copy-paste this into an Info.plist in the Xcode project editor!
- This `OSLogPreferences` dict is 'fully specified' with all the options visible at `man 5 os_log` as of [Feb 2025]
  - We're enabling and persisting all logs to disk
  - We strip 'private' data. (Not sure about this. But it's better to strip 'private' data if we don't need it for debugging I guess.)
  - We enable 'Oversize' messages. (Not sure about this, but we don't want long logs to be cut off, I guess?)
  - We disable all performance analytics (signpost)

Testing Notes [Feb 2025] [macOS 15.3 (24D60)] [MMF build 23676 (right after 3.0.4 Beta 1)]
 - Add the `OSLogPreferences` dict both for mainApp and helperApp Info.plist's â€“ Otherwise it doesn't seem to work for both apps. 
 - When you check the logLevel using `log config --status`, it doesn't seem to be affected by Info.plist â€“ however, the Info.plist dict logLevels still seem to apply in practice when checking `log show`.
- Commands:
  - I used `log config` to check the 'official' (?) logLevels:
    `sudo log config --status --subsystem com.nuebling.mac-mouse-fix`
  - I used `log show` to see all the (persisted?) logs since the last boot:
    `log show --debug --info --last boot --predicate 'subsystem == "com.nuebling.mac-mouse-fix"'`

## 2. Export and Test

- Archive and export the new debug build â€“ Use the 'Release' configuration with optimizations enabled, so app doesn't run slow, (and cause we don't gotta attach a debugger.)
- Perhaps verify that verbose logs appear in the `log show` command (see above) before distributing.
  - Afaik, even at low log levels, high-level logs (like debug and info) are still persisted and possibly show up in `log show`, if they are followed by an error or fault log. Keep that in mind. Wrote more about this somewhere above.

Other:
- Afterwards, simply `git stash`. Don't think we need these debug builds in our git history.
- dsym file for symbolication should be available in Xcode organizer for the forseeable future.

## 3. Distribute

First we can upload the debug build (e.g. to MegaUpload), and then we send the user an email, containing a download link and instructions on how to gather diagnostics. 

(We need MegaUpload or similar, because Gmail doesn't allow attaching .app files â€“ not even when zipped â€“ due to security reasons.)

Here's a template: (Outdated)

```
<FILL IN BEGINNING>

I've created a special debug version of the app. What's special about it, is that it creates very detailed logs about everything it's doing. This will help track down what's happening when the issue occurs.

Here's what to do:

1. Install, and enable the special debug build of Mac Mouse Fix
    - Download link: <FILL IN LINK>

2. When the issue occurs:
    a) Take a **screenshot** (Shift-Command-3) to record the current time.
    b) Document the problem in the logs
        - <FILL IN STEPS>
    c) Collect the logs in a **sysdiagnose** file
        - Press Shift-Control-Option-Command-Period
        - The screen will flash white to show the sysdiagnose process has started.
        - Wait a bit (up to 10 minutes) for completion.
        - Once complete, the file will appear in Finder at `/private/var/tmp/sysdiagnose_[...].tar.gz`

3. Send me the files:
    - Please upload both the **screenshot** and the **sysdiagnose** file to this link: <FILL IN LINK>
    - (You can also send them another way, but the sysdiagnose file is typically too large for email.)

4. Disable logging
    - After sending the files, you can switch back to a regular release of Mac Mouse Fix to stop the detailed logging. (Which takes extra CPU time and memory)

Privacy Note:
The sysdiagnose file contains detailed information about your system.
Personal information is normally removed, but I think some might remain if there are certain bugs in the software on your system.
I will not share your sysdiagnose file with anyone without your permission.

Perhaps we could also link users to Apple's PDF documents with sysdiagnose instructions which can be found at their profiles-and-logs page [10]
  
### How can the user share the large sysdiagnose file?

- Apple Maildrop
    - Easy option for Apple Mail users.
    - Files expire after 30 days.
- swisstransfer.com
    - Very simple & easy interface
    - Files expire after 30 days
- wetransfer.com
   - Pretty simple UI
   - 7 day expiration on free plan
   - Has 'file request' feature. Files expire after 3 days. If I buy the 20â‚¬/month ultimate plan this might increase.
- Cloud Drives
    - No expiration
    - Ask the user to upload to their own Cloud drive (Google Driver, Dropbox, iCloud Drive)
        - Requires account (but most ppl will have some Cloud Drive I think)
        - User has to delete the file manually (annoying)
    - Collaborative folder
        - Requires account (I think)
    - File request
        - No account required
        - **Perfect!**
        - Mega.nz and Dropbox support this, iCloud an Google Drive don't as of [Mar 2025]
	- Providers:
 		- mega.nz
     			- Overview: I love them, the service is very nice and solid, and 20 GB free storage is generous, and should be enough for our usecase.
   			- We could match uploads to bug reports via timestamps,
      			- Or by asking the user to attach the 'upload ID' to their report! (which is attached to the uploaded file names by mega and also shows up in the upload window for the user.)
   		- pcloud.com
       			- Overview: Only 3 GB free, paid prices comparable to mega. Has a lower low tier than mega â€“ 500 GB for 5â‚¬/month, while mega starts at 10â‚¬ IIRC.
     			- We could match uploads to bug reports via the 'name' field.
       		- dropbox.com
           		- Overview: Only 2 GB free, paid prices a bit higher than mega.
         		- We could match uploads to bug reports via the 'name' and 'email' fields.
           		- I kinda hate the interface for some reason, it's flashy but it feels so overbearing. Also, do they wanna spy on user's who enter their email for the file request? Idk I don't like it.
             	- box.com
                	- It's aimed a business and I really don't like it.
                 	- Has upload-only links IIRC
                - Proton Drive
                	- Doesn't have a file-request feature

- Update [Mar 20 2025]:
	- Concern: 
		Ideally users should be able to upload sysdiagnose files right from the place where they file their feedback (Email to me, MMF Feedback Assistant, GitHub Issues)
	   	  In the 'Email to me' case I can send them a personalized Mega.nz upload link - but what about the 'MMF Feedback Assistant' and 'GitHub Issues' cases?
	- Solutions approaches:
 		- Private mega.nz file request via email
   			- This means: We're manually asking users on GitHub to send us an email so we can share a *private, custom* mega.nz upload link with them.
      			- Downside: Introduces several manual extra steps for us and the user, which wastes time and lowers our chances of getting sysdiagnose reports.
		- Public mega.nz file request?
      			- Perhaps we could simply share our Mega.nz upload link publicly on GitHub and MMF Feedback Assistant?
	 		- We could correlate uploads to reports through timestamps?.
    				- But what if that's not good enough? â€“â€“ E.g. if users upload at a much different time than they publish their bug report? Or if multiple users upload around the same time (unlikely, since we never get any logs â€“ that's the reason we're writing this file).
    				- Investigation: Can we programmatically create mega.nz file-requests to better correlate uploaded files with specific bug reports?
					-> I investigated the MEGAcmd app and it seems it can't do that (Source: <export> command's documentation after typing `help -ff` in the repl.)
     					-> I investigated the MEGA webclient source code, but the API it uses to create a file request seems very obscure 
	  				   (Source: https://github.com/meganz/webclient/blob/105193c4fcb734092c7d2a07aeb7fcd63ee06f29/js/filerequest_common.js#L117)
	  				-> If we need more programmatic control over file-requests we might have to use another service than mega.
       					- Update: I just discovered that there are 'Upload IDs'! I think they mostly solve the problem of correlating uploads with bug reports.
	 		- We'd just manually delete old reports if our storage fills up.
    			- If the service is abused
       				- If someone uploads tons of random stuff, our mega.nz account will probably just stop accepting uploads, and we can delete the random files to get it working again.
	   			- If someone sends us a virus I just won't run it, since we don't expect any executable files to be sent to us.
    			-> I feel like that might work.
		- GitHub
			- GitHub Issues:
				- I thought, for commenters in GitHub Issues who aren't as concerned about privacy they might directly attach their sysdiagnose file to their GitHub Issue comment.
        			- Problem: I just tried this with a 350 MB sysdiagnose archive from a user and it just says 'Failed to upload'. I assume there's a filesize limit. 
			- GitHub Releases
 				- Using GitHub API it's pretty easy to upload large files as GitHub release assets (we're also using this to host localization files for our uploadstrings.py script)
   				- Problem: The GitHub 'fine grained' access tokens don't let you permit release asset *uploads* but not *downloads*. 
       					So if we wanted to run this in the user's browsers, e.g. for MMF Feedback Assistant, we couldn't keep the sysdiagnose files private.
			- Also see: GitHub's article 'About large files on GitHub' (didn't read thoroughly, yet): https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github
		
  		- Custom cloud upload service
			- AWS:
	 			- is pretty hard to use.
   				- Doesn't have good abuse protection afaik. Real chance of getting Ginormous bills if there's serious abuse.
	     		- Vercel:
      				- Blob storage is 250MB/month in free tier -> Too low. (Source: https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob/usage-and-pricing)
        		- Netlify:
	        		- Has free tier which simply suspends when rate limits are reached -> Built in, easy abuse protection.
        	    		- Blobs don't cost anything currently. Their developer said, that the plan is: "Customers get 100GB for free, and additional GBs will cost 9 cents a month"
            		  	  (Source: https://answers.netlify.com/t/blobs-pricing-and-limits/119907/2)
					- -> Sounds totally good enough for our use case
     			- ([Mar 2025] I'm currently not aware of other competitors to AWS, Vercel, Netlify, and I also didn't Google for any)
     			- ([Apr 2025] ... I think I became aware of Netlify and Vercel when I originally looked into AWS for lamda function in early 2024? Would be interesting what other alternatives we considered. Can't find any older notes mentioning Netlify or Vercel though.)

	- Conclusion: [Mar 2025]
 		- Fine solution for now: Simply sharing our mega.nz upload links publicly and asking users to attach the 'Upload ID' to their bug report so we can correlate the uploaded files should work totally fine! 
   			(Or we could perhaps even correlate the files via timestamp.)
   		- If that's not enough: netlify.
     			- Contra vs mega.nz: 	1. Way more work for us. 2. Uploaded files probably harder to handle for us.
			- Pro vs mega.nz: 	1. 100 GB free storage 2. More optimization possibility for UX [a) Letting MMF app upload files automatically b) embedding an uploading UI into the Feedback Assistant page c) Users don't have to manually share the 'Upload ID' from mega]

The description for a *personalized* file request could be this:

```
Please upload the screenshot you took & your sysdiagnose archive (whose file extension should be .tar.gz). Thank you!
```

The description for a *public* file request could be this: 	(3 different variants for 3 different communication channels: Feedback Assistant, Email, GH Issue.) (Update: Actually, the email one might not make sense, since for those we can create personalized file requests.)
```
Please 1. Upload your screenshot and the sysdiagnose archive (with the file extension '.tar.gz') || 2. Copy the 'Upload ID' (shown below) and add it to your Bug Report. That way I'll know which files belong to which report. || Thank you!
```
```
Please 1. Upload your screenshot and the sysdiagnose archive (with the file extension '.tar.gz') || 2. Copy the 'Upload ID' (shown below) and send it to me via Email. That way I'll know which files belong to which report. || Thank you!
```
```
Please 1. Upload your screenshot and the sysdiagnose archive (with the file extension '.tar.gz') || 2. Copy the 'Upload ID' (shown below) and post it under our GitHub Issue. That way I'll know which files belong to which report. || Thank you very much!
```

(mega.nz doesn't support linebreaks [Mar 2025] so we used '||' instead.)

## Notes from investigating first sysdiagnose we've been sent [Mar 17 2025]

(The sysdiagnose from M Dino)

Inspecting screenshot timestamps:
- Bad options:
    - Finder only has minute-precision for timestamps.
    - `stat` clt requires complex args to get human-readable output with timezone info.
	Couldn't find a way to get it to print sub-second precision at all.
- Good option: `gstat <filename>`
	- Displays all info about the timestamps in a human-readable way.
        	- Including sub-second precision.
   		- Including timezone info.
        - Timstamps are in ISO 8601 format â€“ just like the timestamps displayed for system_logs.logarchive in Console.app
		- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
        	- Don't forget: Suffix `+0700` means: The timestamp is in the 'UTC + 7 hours' timezone. So to get UTC time, you have to *subtract* 7.
- Sometimes we saw information missing from a file's timestamps:
        - Sub-second precision: I tested with Keka: .zip, and .tar.gz stripped sub-second information, while .7z kept it. Didn't test anything else.
  	- Timezones: Observation: `gstat` and other timestamp-viewers always converted the timestamps to my current system's timezone, even though examples outputs on the web from Linux users didn't seem to do that. I assume that's because the timestamps on my files don't contain timezone-info and are just stored in absolute time since 1970 or whatever.
  		- -> Idk if macOS never records timezone info in file-timestamps or if this info was also stripped by the archiving. (Didn't test.)

## Learnings from trying the 'Short Term Solution' [Apr 8 2025]

In the last few weeks I've been trying to collect logs about [this issue](./bug-investigation/scrolling-stops-intermittently_apr-2025.md) using the 'Short Term Solution' approach, but we've had very little success. We still didn't get any logs.
I'm not sure why. Reasons I can think of:

- I'm communicating in a bad way 
    - I don't really know what to do better though. 
        - I think I used to be more charming? But I can't force that, since I'm dead inside now.
        - I could try to be more concise. Try my best not to waste people's time. With the one person that was willing to collect logs about this so far (https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/issues/1339#issuecomment-2785241013), I was being very concise for my standards.
- The steps are too much effort/mentally taxing.
    - See 'Mid Term Solution' for ideas on improving that.
- The privacy stuff turns ppl off 
    - Maybe only collecting MMF logs instead of the whole sysdiagnose? 
        - Pro: That would have less chance of containing sensitive data. 
        - Contra: But it would also be harder to implement in a way that's easy-to-do for the user, since sysdiagnose has the nice shift-control-option-command-period shortcut.
        - Contra: It would give us less data, making it harder to debug if the issue doesn't just stem from MMF but some interaction/bug with macOS/the environment. (Which I assume is often the case for these sporadic bugs.)
- META: Naturally, ppl don't really give feedback about *why* they ghost you. So this is a bit hard to understand.

# Update [Apr 2025] - Mid Term Solution - debugmode-toggle

Also see: 
    <# Idea -> 3 - 6. could all be turned into one or two steps for the user>

The 'optimal solution' we planned earlier â€“ A dedicated **debugmode-statusbaritem** â€“ has downsides, therefore we plan a medium-term solution: **debugmode-toggle**. It would be:
    - Relatively easy to implement
    - Simplifies steps 1. and 6. (installing and uninstalling debug build) â€“ already significant reduction of friction for users

UI ideas for debugmode-toggle:
    - Add 'Enable Debug Mode' toggle in 'Mac Mouse Fix' menubar item (next to the Apple Logo.). Perhaps hidden with Option modifier.
    - When enabled, add checkbox at end of General tab that says '- [x] Enable Debug Mode'. User can easily disable it from there. Should blend in very nicely with rest of GeneralTab UI. Maybe we could add a little bug glyph to make it stick out more? The SFSymbols ladybug glyph is nice and cute.
    - Maybe add secondary label below that checkbox 
        - Brainstorm about secondary label:
            - Could explain what debug mode is, how to collect and send logs, or why you should probably keep it disabled unless you're planning to submit a Bug Report. (Not sure what to include there.)
            - Maybe it could just say 'Mac Mouse Fix is recording information for a Bug Report...' ... but that might imply that it'll automatically create a bug report or something.
            - Maybe it could say "Recording Information that you can share in a [Bug Report](<link>)..."

Should we name it 'Debug Mode'?
    We might come up with something better. I feel like Debug Mode won't translate super well into other languages? But everybody has to have a term for software bugs so maybe it's ok.
    Ideas:
        - Diagnostic Mode
        - '[x] Record Debug Information'
            - (Might imply it's a one-time-action)

How could we move from debugmode-toggle to debugmode-statusbaritem if debugmode-toggle isn't enough?
    We'd have to make the following UI adjustments: 
        Instead/additionally to `[x] Enable Debug Mode` toggle on General tab we'd have the debugmode-statusbaritem.
        -> Should be easy to change.

**Downsides** of debugmode-statusbaritem:

    (Reminder: statusbaritem would automate/guide user through steps 2 - 6.: make timestamp when issue occurs, record issue in logs, collect logs, upload logs, disable debugmode)

    - Quite hard to implement.
    - Takes time to build and polish - possibly not worth it
        - We don't seem to get many of these rare, hard-to-debug issues. And I assume that once we make things more single threaded with an IOThread, it should become even more stable. So it might not be worth spending so much time to make reporting experience better for those 2 or so hard-to-reproduce bugs we get a year. (Might be an understatement, my memory is bad.)
    - After implementing debugmode-toggle, there might be simple ways of reducing friction even further, without switching to debugmode-statusbaritem
        - Of the remaining steps that could be optimized after implementing a debugmode-toggle (3 - 5.), uploading seem the most friction-full.
        - Uploading could be streamlined in other ways, e.g. by allowing uploads to Netlify blob directly on the Feedback Assistant page instead of relying on Mega.io upload links.
    - Might itself be bug-prone.
        - Running things in background is bug-prone
            - Think about how much pain and macOS bugs we went through over the years to reliably enable 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper', we'd basically have to do the same thing for a hypothetical new 'Mac Mouse Fix Debug Mode Helper' process
                ... Although I guess we could reuse the existing logic for 'Mac Mouse Fix Helper', or simply use the loginitem API which seems simpler but won't restart on crashes. (Crashes seem unlikely though)
        - It's just a lot of steps with file-interactions, user interactions, using sysdiagnose clt and waiting for its response. Possible race-conditions. We could probably make it very stable, but it might require a lot of careful attention and work.
    - Inflexible
        - Kinda sets the process in stone. This might be bad if:
            - we wanna change the process (e.g. upload to a different place) 
            - if macOS changes (e.g. requires additional permissions to collect sysdiagnose or something) 
            - if we find the process doesn't make sense for a significant percentage of the bugs we wanna record info about (E.g. if collecting timestamp proves useless for most cases). 
                - I don't have enough experience with these bug reports to know for sure whether the process always makes sense. Might be able to come to conclusion by thinking hard.
            - If it makes sense for users to notify me through different channels (If we already had conversation on GitHub/Email it probably makes sense to continue conversation on respective channel.)
        -> I feel like all these problems aren't super bad / solvable when you think about them. But it does seem unwise to formalize the process too much before we have experience with how it works in practice â€“ which is hard to acquire experience since people very rarely send us debug logs... Hopefully the debugmode-toggle will change that.


## Mid Term Solution pt 2
[Apr 8 2025]

Problem: I have long phases where I don't communicate. This makes it hard to collect logs, since we need to manually send tailor-made instructions to users for how to collect debug-logs.
Solution ideas:
    - Should maybe add instructions to MMF Feedback Assistant to allow users to proactively record and send sysdiagnose. Then we can perhaps collect sysdiagnose in our no-communication phases, and analyze them later. 
        Though I'm not sure if we can actually effectively solve bugs without taylored-to-problem back-and-forth communication. (I just don't think I can do that consistently, though)
    - Maybe set aside time regularly to communicate with users and ask them for debug logs.
        - E.g. for the 'Scroll Stops Intermittently' issue, we could set aside time after macOS updates, since that's when the reports alwasy come in.
